# 🌿 Herbal Health Advisor
## 📝 Overview
The Herbal Health Advisor is a web-based application that provides natural, plant-based remedies based on user-inputted symptoms. Designed with both Tamil and English language support, the platform leverages fuzzy logic and machine learning to analyze user feedback and refine recommendations.
## 🌟Features
- **Symptom Input**: Users can enter symptoms to receive herbal remedy suggestions.
- **Language Support**: Remedies are displayed in both Tamil and English for accessibility.
- **Plant Remedies with Images**: Detailed information on each plant remedy, including 
images, to help users identify and understand treatments.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Feedback is collected and analyzed using Natural Language 
Processing (NLP) and machine learning to categorize sentiment as positive, negative, or 
neutral.
- **AI and Machine Learning Integration**:
 - Supervised Learning: Uses classification and regression algorithms.
 - Unsupervised Learning: Implements clustering (K-means).
 - Sentiment classification powered by Bayes classification and TextBlob.
 - Prediction module that selects algorithms based on accuracy.
 - Evaluation module using iterative processes for dataset training.

## Project Modules
1. **Data Collection**: Collects user-generated comments from forums, blogs, and social 
networks using APIs.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stemming, and filtering are applied to prepare data 
for analysis.
3. **Sentiment Classification**: Categorizes user feedback into positive, negative, or neutral 
sentiments.
4. **Machine Learning Algorithms**:
 - **Supervised Learning**: Classification and regression models for accurate predictions.'

 - **Unsupervised Learning**: Clustering with K-means to group similar data points.
5. **Prediction and Evaluation**: Optimizes algorithm accuracy and continually improves 
predictions through dataset training.
